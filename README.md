# 09-Juicy-Breakout

Today, I updated my previous assignment, '08-Breakout.' As I mentioned on 'E09b-Game Feel,' I made my project juicy by adding the following elements: background image, background music, and sound effects. For the background image, I went to a website called 'openart.org.' I searched for background and found an image called 'Fortress background/storyboard image.' I downloaded the image and added to my project by using godot.

Next, I searched for background music and found a soundtrack called 'Frozen Jam (Seamless Loop).' I downloaded the music and added to my project. While I was adding the music, I used a node called 'AudioStreamPlayer.' This node allowed me to add Frozen Jam as background music. I clicked on AutoPlay so background music can be played whenever my game is played. 

Then, I searched for sound effect and found a file called 'Pong.' I installed the file and added to my project. For adding the sound effect, I had to edit ball's script. In line 21, I added the following code: WorldNode.find_node('Pong').playing = true. Updating the script allowed the game to make sound effects. Whenever the ball hits tiles, it makes a noise.

After that, I went to GitHub Desktop and found a box called 'Summary (required).' In the box, I typed 'Finished Updatng.' Then, I clicked on a blue box saying 'Commit to master.' After cliking the box, I pushed the repository.

Finally, I edited my LICENSE and README.md.
